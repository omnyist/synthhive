# Botbesties

Multi-tenant Twitch bot platform built with Django + TwitchIO 3.x.

## Architecture

Two Docker containers share the same codebase and PostgreSQL database:

- **server** — Daphne ASGI app serving Django admin, API, and OAuth setup pages on port 7177.
- **bot** — Runs `manage.py runbot`, which starts one `BotClient` (TwitchIO) per active bot record. Each bot gets its own AiohttpAdapter port (base 4343, incrementing).

## Data Model

- **Bot** — A Twitch bot identity (e.g., Elsydeon, WorldFriendshipBot). Holds encrypted OAuth tokens.
- **Channel** — A channel where a bot is active. FK to Bot. Also stores the channel owner's OAuth tokens for moderation.
- **Command** — A chat command (e.g., `!lurk`) defined per channel. The `type` field determines how the response is chosen (text, lottery, random_list, counter). The `config` JSONField stores type-specific settings. Response text supports variables. `created_by` tracks who created it (Twitch username from `!addcom`, or channel owner name from imports).
- **Skill** — A Python-coded command toggled per channel. Used for complex built-in behaviors that need real Python logic (future: quotes, followage, API integrations). Logic lives in `bot/skills/` as handler classes, the model controls enable/disable and stores JSON config.
- **Counter** — A named counter per channel (e.g., death count, scare count). Dedicated model with `IntegerField` for atomic `F()` updates. Readable in command responses via `$(count.get name)`.
- **Alias** — A type-agnostic command alias per channel. Resolved early in the message pipeline to rewrite triggers before routing (e.g., `!ct` → `!count death`). Works for all command types and skills.

## Command Types

Commands use a two-tier architecture: **command types** for config-driven behaviors, and **skill handlers** for complex Python-coded behaviors.

### Type-Based Commands

The `type` field on the Command model determines how the response is chosen and what side effects happen. All types share the same response processing pipeline (variables, `/me` handling, use_count).

| Type | Example | Response Source | Side Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `text` | `!lurk` | `command.response` template | None |
| `lottery` | `!getyeflask` | Roll `config["odds"]` → pick `config["success"]` or `config["failure"]` | None |
| `random_list` | `!conch` | Random pick from `config["responses"]`, optional `config["prefix"]` | None |
| `counter` | `!deaths` | `command.response` template (uses `$(count.get name)`) | Auto-increment named counter |

### Config Schemas

**lottery:**
```json
{"odds": 2, "success": "$(user) wins!", "failure": "Better luck next time!", "cooldown": 3600, "cooldown_response": "$(user), $(remaining) left!"}
```
`odds` is a percentage (1-100). Success/failure templates support variables. `cooldown` is optional seconds between attempts per user (0 or omitted = no cooldown). `cooldown_response` is the template shown when on cooldown (omit to silently ignore). Supports `$(remaining)` for human-readable remaining time (e.g., `0h 59m`, `4m 30s`, `45s`). Cooldowns are in-memory and reset on bot restart.

**random_list:**
```json
{"prefix": "🐚 ", "responses": ["Yes.", "No.", "Maybe."]}
```
`prefix` is optional, prepended to the chosen response. Responses support variables.

**counter:**
```json
{"counter_name": "death"}
```
`counter_name` defaults to the command name if omitted. The counter is auto-incremented before variable processing so `$(count.get name)` returns the updated value.

### Skill Handlers

Skills are Python handler classes in `bot/skills/` for complex built-in behaviors that need real Python logic (future: shoutout, quotes, followage, API integrations). Each skill is a `SkillHandler` subclass registered in `SKILL_REGISTRY`. The router checks commands first, then falls back to skill handlers.

Handler signature: `handle(self, payload, args, skill, bot)` — the `bot` parameter gives handlers access to the TwitchIO client for API calls (e.g., `bot.fetch_users()`).

## Message Processing Pipeline

The `CommandRouter` (`bot/router.py`) is a TwitchIO Component with a single `event_message` listener. Processing order:

1. **Self-message guard** — Skip if chatter is the bot itself
2. **Prefix check** — Skip if message doesn't start with `!`
3. **Skip built-in commands** — Management commands handled by `ManagementCommands` (`addcom`, `editcom`, `delcom`, `commands`, `id`, `alias`, `unalias`, `aliases`, `count`, `counters`)
4. **Alias resolution** — Rewrite trigger via `Alias` model (e.g., `!ct` → `!count death`)
5. **Command lookup** — Query `Command` table by channel + name. If found and enabled, dispatch by type:
   - `text`: use `command.response`
   - `lottery`: roll odds → pick success or failure from config
   - `random_list`: random pick from `config["responses"]`, prepend prefix
   - `counter`: auto-increment named counter, use `command.response`
   - Common pipeline: increment use_count → build VariableContext → process variables → handle `/me` → respond
6. **Skill handler fallback** — Look up handler in `SKILL_REGISTRY`, query `Skill` model, call `handler.handle()`

## Variable System

Variables use `$(namespace.property args)` syntax in command responses. Defined in `bot/variables.py` as a registry of handler classes. Each handler owns a namespace and has `resolve()` and `describe()` methods.

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `$(user)` | Display name of the chatter who triggered the command |
| `$(target)` | First argument after the command (with `@` stripped). Falls back to `$(user)` if no argument given |
| `$(channel)` | Current channel name |
| `$(uses)` | How many times this text command has been used |
| `$(count.get <name>)` | Current value of a named counter |
| `$(count.label <name>)` | Display label of a named counter |
| `$(random.range N-M)` | Random integer between N and M |
| `$(random.pick a,b,c)` | Random choice from a comma-separated list |
| `$(query)` | Full argument string after the command name |
| `$(1)`, `$(2)`, ... | Positional arguments (1-based) |

### /me Action Messages

If a command's response starts with `/me `, the bot sends it as a Twitch action message (italicized). The optional `- ` separator after `/me` is also stripped (convention from Spoonee's commands).

### Security

- The bot ignores its own messages to prevent command chaining.
- `$(target)` strips leading `@` only. The self-message guard prevents injection of `!commands` or `/me` via target arguments.

## Alias System

Aliases are type-agnostic command rewrites. When someone types `!ct`, the router looks up the Alias table and rewrites it to `!count death` before routing. This works for both text commands and skills.

| Command | Permission | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `!alias <name> <target>` | Mod/Broadcaster | Create an alias (e.g., `!alias ct count death`) |
| `!unalias <name>` | Mod/Broadcaster | Remove an alias |
| `!aliases` | Everyone | List all aliases for the channel |

## Counter System

Counters are named per-channel values stored in the `Counter` model. They use Django `F()` expressions for atomic increments.

| Command | Permission | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `!count <name>` | Everyone | Show a counter's value |
| `!count <name> +` | Mod/Broadcaster | Increment a counter |
| `!count <name> -` | Mod/Broadcaster | Decrement a counter |
| `!count <name> set <N>` | Mod/Broadcaster | Set a counter to a specific value |
| `!counters` | Everyone | List all counters and their values |

Counters are also accessible in command responses via `$(count.get <name>)` and `$(count.label <name>)`. Counter values can be edited directly in Django admin.

## Deployment

Automated via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`). Pushes to `main` trigger a deploy to the self-hosted runner on Saya.

- **Domain**: `bots.bardsaders.com` behind Cloudflare Zero Trust.
- **Server access**: `ssh saya`. Use `docker exec` for container interaction, not `docker compose`.
- **Startup sequence**: migrate → seed → collectstatic → Daphne.

### Static Files

WhiteNoise does not work under ASGI/Daphne (sync-only middleware). Static files are served via Django's `django.views.static.serve` through a URL route in `botbesties/urls.py`.

## Twitch IDs

| Name | Twitch User ID | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Avalonstar | 38981465 | Channel owner |
| Spoonee | 78238052 | Channel owner |
| Elsydeon | 66977097 | Bot |
| WorldFriendshipBot | 149214941 | Bot |

## Development

- **Python 3.13**, managed by `uv`.
- **Linting**: Ruff (config in `pyproject.toml`). Single-line imports, `from __future__ import annotations` required.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16. All models use UUID primary keys.
- **Encryption**: django-fernet-encrypted-fields for OAuth tokens.
